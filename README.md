# Timeline App

### Task #1
This is a basic structure for a **Timeline Web Application** using semantic HTML5 elements. The layout is designed for future expansion and can serve as a starting point for a timeline or event-based application.

### Task #2 
In this task I applied css for a **Timeline Web Application** using semantic class-based selectors. It applies a dark theme with basic text and background colors, ensures consistent spacing, margins, and borders, and implements a fully responsive layout for all devices via media queries.

### Task #3
This task adds interactivity to the **Timeline Web Application** using vanilla JavaScript. It fetches event data from an external `data.json` file containing 8 sample events (with year, title, description, imageURL, and category).

The script dynamically renders event markers into the #timeline element and attaches click handlers so that selecting a marker opens a modal (#modal) displaying the eventâ€™s details. A close button is implemented to hide the modal, ensuring smooth user interaction. The `index.html` file is updated to load `script.js` at the end of the `<body>` to ensure all DOM elements are available before execution.
