# Timeline App

### Task #2 
In this task I applied css for a **Timeline Web Application** using semantic class-based selectors. It applies a dark theme with basic text and background colors, ensures consistent spacing, margins, and borders, and implements a fully responsive layout for all devices via media queries.
