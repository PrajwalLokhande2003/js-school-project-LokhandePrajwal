# Timeline App

### Task #1
This is a basic structure for a **Timeline Web Application** using semantic HTML5 elements. The layout is designed for future expansion and can serve as a starting point for a timeline or event-based application.

### Task #2 
In this task I applied css for a **Timeline Web Application** using semantic class-based selectors. It applies a dark theme with basic text and background colors, ensures consistent spacing, margins, and borders, and implements a fully responsive layout for all devices via media queries.
